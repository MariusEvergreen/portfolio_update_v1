        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>If I could describe my personality with a single word, since the early childhood until now, that'd be: <em>Adventurer.</em></p>
        <p>I am 22yo now and the adventure only seems to begin (or it began a long time ago). I moved from my homecountry to Italy when I was 15yo to become a dental technician. Not quite what I dreamed of but I never knew what exactly I wanted to become. Even after graduating from Highschool, my struggle still thrived. And the main reason was my <em>ambivalent</em> personality. One part being the artistic mind, and the other part being the scientific mind. Trying to choose only one of them I could not find the right path until I understood that I had to create my own one by combining those elements toghether. That lead me to the Front-End Development: a beatiful combination of desing and technology. In addition the lifestyle of a Web Dev was just what i needed: freedom of choice. :)</p>
